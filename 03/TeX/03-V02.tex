\section{Normal distribution}
\label{normalDist}

Among all the distributions we see in practice, one is overwhelmingly the most common. The symmetric, unimodal, bell curve is ubiquitous throughout statistics. Indeed it is so common, that people often know it as the \term{normal curve} or \termsub{normal distribution}{distribution!normal},\footnote{It is also introduced as the Gaussian distribution after Frederic Gauss, the first person to formalize its mathematical expression.} shown in Figure~\ref{simpleNormal}. Variables such as SAT scores and heights of US adult males closely follow the normal distribution.

\end{figure}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Normal distribution facts}
Many variables are nearly normal, but none are exactly normal. Thus the normal distribution, while not perfect for any single problem, is very useful for a variety of problems. We will use it in data exploration and to solve important problems in statistics.\vspace{0.7mm}}
\end{termBox}

\subsection{Normal distribution model}

The normal distribution model always describes a symmetric, unimodal, bell shaped curve. However, these curves can look different depending on the details of the model. Specifically, the normal distribution model can be adjusted using two parameters: mean and standard deviation. As you can probably guess, changing the mean shifts the bell curve to the left or right, while changing the standard deviation stretches or constricts the curve. Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormals} shows the normal distribution with mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$ in the left panel and the normal distributions with mean $19$ and standard deviation $4$ in the right panel. Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormalsStacked} shows these distributions on the same axis.

\begin{figure}[hht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{03/figures/twoSampleNormals/twoSampleNormals}
\caption{Both curves represent the normal distribution, however, they differ in their center and spread. The normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 is called the \term{standard normal distribution}.}
\label{twoSampleNormals}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[hht]

\includegraphics[width=0.62\textwidth]{03/figures/twoSampleNormalsStacked/twoSampleNormalsStacked}
\caption{The normal models shown in Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormals} but plotted together and on the same scale.}
\label{twoSampleNormalsStacked}
\end{figure}

If a normal distribution has mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, we may write the distribution as $N(\mu, \sigma)$\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-5mm}

$N(\mu, \sigma)$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Normal dist.\\with mean $\mu$\\\& st. dev. $\sigma$]{\raggedright\vspace{-5mm}

$N(\mu, \sigma)$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Normal dist.\\with mean $\mu$\\\& st. dev. $\sigma$}. The two distributions in Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormalsStacked} can be written as
\begin{align*}
N(\mu=0,\sigma=1)\quad\text{and}\quad N(\mu=19,\sigma=4)
\end{align*}
Because the mean and standard deviation describe a normal distribution exactly, they are called the distribution's \termsub{parameters}{parameter}.

\begin{exercise}
Write down the short-hand for a normal distribution with (a)~mean~5 and standard deviation~3, (b)~mean~-100 and standard deviation~10, and (c)~mean~2 and standard deviation~9.\footnote{(a)~$N(\mu=5,\sigma=3)$. (b)~$N(\mu=-100, \sigma=10)$. (c)~$N(\mu=2, \sigma=9)$.}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Standardizing with Z scores}

\begin{example}{Table~\vref{satACTstats} shows the mean and standard deviation for total scores on the SAT and ACT. The distribution of SAT and ACT scores are both nearly normal. Suppose Ann scored 1800 on her SAT and Tom scored 24 on his ACT. Who performed better?}\label{actSAT}
We use the standard deviation as a guide. Ann is 1 standard deviation above average on the SAT: $1500 + 300=1800$. Tom is 0.6 standard deviations above the mean on the ACT: $21+0.6\times 5=24$. In Figure~\ref{satActNormals}, we can see that Ann tends to do better with respect to everyone else than Tom did, so her score was better.
\end{example}

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l r r}
  \hline
  & SAT & ACT \\
  \hline
Mean \hspace{0.3cm} & 1500 & 21 \\
SD & 300 & 5 \\
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Mean and standard deviation for the SAT and ACT.}
\label{satACTstats}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=65mm]{03/figures/satActNormals/satActNormals}
\caption{Ann's and Tom's scores shown with the distributions of SAT and ACT scores.}
\label{satActNormals}
\end{figure}

Example~\ref{actSAT} used a standardization technique called a Z score, a method most commonly employed for nearly normal observations but that may be used with any distribution. The \term{Z score}\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-3mm}

$Z$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Z score, the\\standardized\\observation]{\raggedright\vspace{-3mm}

$Z$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Z score, the\\standardized\\observation}\index{Z@$Z$} of an observation is defined as the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean. If the observation is one standard deviation above the mean, its Z score is 1. If it is 1.5 standard deviations \emph{below} the mean, then its Z score is -1.5. If $x$ is an observation from a distribution $N(\mu, \sigma)$, we define the Z score mathematically as
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
\end{eqnarray*}
Using $\mu_{SAT}=1500$, $\sigma_{SAT}=300$, and $x_{Ann}=1800$, we find Ann's Z score:
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z_{Ann} = \frac{x_{Ann} - \mu_{SAT}}{\sigma_{SAT}} = \frac{1800-1500}{300} = 1
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{The Z score}
The Z score of an observation is the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean. We compute the Z score for an observation $x$ that follows a distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ using
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
\end{eqnarray*}}
\end{termBox}

\begin{exercise}
Use Tom's ACT score, 24, along with the ACT mean and standard deviation to compute his Z score.\footnote{$Z_{Tom} = \frac{x_{Tom} - \mu_{ACT}}{\sigma_{ACT}} = \frac{24 - 21}{5} = 0.6$}
\end{exercise}

Observations above the mean always have positive Z scores while those below the mean have negative Z scores. If an observation is equal to the mean (e.g. SAT score of 1500), then the Z score is $0$.

\begin{exercise}
Let $X$ represent a random variable from $N(\mu=3, \sigma=2)$, and suppose we observe $x=5.19$. (a) Find the Z score of $x$. (b) Use the Z score to determine how many standard deviations above or below the mean $x$ falls.\footnote{(a) Its Z score is given by $Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{5.19 - 3}{2} = 2.19/2 = 1.095$. (b) The observation $x$ is 1.095 standard deviations \emph{above} the mean. We know it must be above the mean since $Z$ is positive.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{headLZScore}
Head lengths of brushtail possums follow a nearly normal distribution with mean 92.6 mm and standard deviation 3.6 mm. Compute the Z scores for possums with head lengths of 95.4 mm and 85.8 mm.\footnote{For $x_1=95.4$ mm: $Z_1 = \frac{x_1 - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{95.4 - 92.6}{3.6} = 0.78$. For $x_2=85.8$ mm: $Z_2 = \frac{85.8 - 92.6}{3.6} = -1.89$.}
\end{exercise}

We can use Z scores to roughly identify which observations are more unusual than others. One observation $x_1$ is said to be more unusual than another observation $x_2$ if the absolute value of its Z score is larger than the absolute value of the other observation's Z score: $|Z_1| > |Z_2|$. This technique is especially insightful when a distribution is symmetric.

\begin{exercise}
Which of the observations in Exercise~\ref{headLZScore} is more unusual?\footnote{Because the \emph{absolute value} of Z score for the second observation is larger than that of the first, the second observation has a more unusual head length.}
\end{exercise}

%\begin{exercise} \label{email_num_char_ZScore}
%The variable \var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char} from the \data{email} data set describes the number of characters in nearly 4,000 emails. The distribution has mean 10,476 and standard deviation 14,383. Identify the Z scores for $\var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char}_{36}=13,788$ mm and $\var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char}_{79}=3,485$, which correspond to the $36^{th}$ and $76^{th}$ emails in the data set.\footnote{$Z_{36} = \frac{13,788 - 10,476}{14,383} = 0.23$, $Z_{79} = \frac{3,485 - 10,476}{14,383} = -0.49$}
%\end{exercise}

%\begin{exercise}
%Which of the observations in Exercise~\ref{email_num_char_ZScore} is more unusual?\footnote{In Exercise~\ref{email_num_char_ZScore}, $Z_{36} = 0.23$ and $Z_{79}=-0.49$. Because the \emph{absolute value} of $Z_{79}$ is larger than $Z_{36}$, case 79 appears to have a more unusual number of email characters.}
%\end{exercise}

\subsection{Normal probability table}

\begin{example}{Ann from Example~\ref{actSAT} earned a score of 1800 on her SAT with a corresponding $Z=1$. She would like to know what percentile she falls in among all SAT test-takers.}
Ann's \term{percentile} is the percentage of people who earned a lower SAT score than Ann. We shade the area representing those individuals in Figure~\ref{satBelow1800}. The total area under the normal curve is always equal to 1, and the proportion of people who scored below Ann on the SAT is equal to the \emph{area} shaded in Figure~\ref{satBelow1800}: 0.8413. In other words, Ann is in the $84^{th}$ percentile of SAT takers.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}[htb]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[height=1.5in]{03/figures/satBelow1800/satBelow1800}
   \caption{The normal model for SAT scores, shading the area of those individuals who scored below Ann.}
   \label{satBelow1800}
\end{figure}

We can use the normal model to find percentiles. A \term{normal probability table}, which lists Z scores and corresponding percentiles, can be used to identify a percentile based on the Z score (and vice versa). Statistical software can also be used.

A normal probability table is given in Appendix~\vref{normalProbabilityTable} and abbreviated in Table~\ref{zTableShort}. We use this table to identify the percentile corresponding to any particular Z score. For instance, the percentile of $Z=0.43$ is shown in row $0.4$ and column $0.03$ in Table~\ref{zTableShort}: 0.6664, or the $66.64^{th}$ percentile. Generally, we round $Z$ to two decimals, identify the proper row in the normal probability table up through the first decimal, and then determine the column representing the second decimal value. The intersection of this row and column is the percentile of the observation.

\caption{A section of the normal probability table. The percentile for a normal random variable with $Z=0.43$ has been \highlightT{highlighted}, and the percentile closest to 0.8000 has also been \highlightO{highlighted}.}
\label{zTableShort}
\end{table}

We can also find the Z score associated with a percentile. For example, to identify Z for the $80^{th}$ percentile, we look for the value closest to 0.8000 in the middle portion of the table: 0.7995. We determine the Z score for the $80^{th}$ percentile by combining the row and column Z values: 0.84.

\begin{exercise}
Determine the proportion of SAT test takers who scored better than Ann on the SAT.\footnote{If 84\% had lower scores than Ann, the number of people who had better scores must be 16\%. (Generally ties are ignored when the normal model, or any other continuous distribution, is used.)}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Normal probability examples}

Cumulative SAT scores are approximated well by a normal model, $N(\mu=1500, \sigma=300)$.

\begin{example}{Shannon is a randomly selected SAT taker, and nothing is known about Shannon's SAT aptitude. What is the probability Shannon scores at least 1630 on her SATs?}\label{satAbove1630Exam}
First, always draw and label a picture of the normal distribution. (Drawings need not be exact to be useful.) We are interested in the chance she scores above 1630, so we shade this upper tail:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.9in]{03/figures/satAbove1630/satAbove1630}
\end{center}
The picture shows the mean and the values at 2 standard deviations above and below the mean. The simplest way to find the shaded area under the curve makes use of the Z score of the cutoff value. With $\mu=1500$, $\sigma=300$, and the cutoff value $x=1630$, the Z score is computed as
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{1630 - 1500}{300} = \frac{130}{300} = 0.43
\end{eqnarray*}
We look up the percentile of $Z=0.43$ in the normal probability table shown in Table~\ref{zTableShort} or in Appendix~\vref{normalProbabilityTable}, which yields 0.6664. However, the percentile describes those who had a Z score \emph{lower} than 0.43. To find the area \emph{above} $Z=0.43$, we compute one minus the area of the lower tail:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.8in]{03/figures/subtractingArea/subtractingArea}
\end{center}
The probability Shannon scores at least 1630 on the SAT is 0.3336.
\end{example}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{always draw a picture first, and find the Z score second}
For any normal probability situation, \emph{always always always} draw and label the normal curve and shade the area of interest first. The picture will provide an estimate of the probability. \vspace{3mm}

After drawing a figure to represent the situation, identify the Z score for the observation of interest.\vspace{1mm}}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{exercise}
If the probability of Shannon scoring at least 1630 is 0.3336, then what is the probability she scores less than 1630? Draw the normal curve representing this exercise, shading the lower region instead of the upper one.\footnote{We found the probability in Example~\ref{satAbove1630Exam}: 0.6664. A picture for this exercise is represented by the shaded area below ``0.6664'' in Example~\ref{satAbove1630Exam}.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{Edward earned a 1400 on his SAT. What is his percentile?} \label{edwardSatBelow1400}
First, a picture is needed. Edward's percentile is the proportion of people who do not get as high as a 1400. These are the scores to the left of 1400.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=22mm]{03/figures/satBelow1400/satBelow1400}
\end{center}
Identifying the mean $\mu=1500$, the standard deviation $\sigma=300$, and the cutoff for the tail area $x=1400$ makes it easy to compute the Z score:
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{1400 - 1500}{300} = -0.33
\end{eqnarray*}
Using the normal probability table, identify the row of $-0.3$ and column of $0.03$, which corresponds to the probability $0.3707$. Edward is at the $37^{th}$ percentile.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Use the results of Example~\ref{edwardSatBelow1400} to compute the proportion of SAT takers who did better than Edward. Also draw a new picture.\footnote{If Edward did better than 37\% of SAT takers, then about 63\% must have done better than him. \\
\includegraphics[height=12mm]{03/figures/satBelow1400/satAbove1400}}
\end{exercise}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{areas to the right}
The normal probability table in most books gives the area to the left. If you would like the area to the right, first find the area to the left and then subtract this amount from~one.}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{exercise}
Stuart earned an SAT score of 2100. Draw a picture for each part. (a)~What is his percentile? (b)~What percent of SAT takers did better than Stuart?\footnote{Numerical answers: (a) 0.9772. (b) 0.0228.}
\end{exercise}

Based on a sample of 100 men,\footnote{This sample was taken from the USDA Food Commodity Intake Database.} the heights of male adults between the ages 20 and 62 in the US is nearly normal with mean 70.0'' and standard deviation 3.3''.

\begin{exercise}
Mike is 5'7'' and Jim is 6'4''. (a) What is Mike's height percentile? (b) What is Jim's height percentile? Also draw one picture for each part.\footnote{First put the heights into inches: 67 and 76 inches. Figures are shown below. (a) $Z_{Mike} = \frac{67 - 70}{3.3} = -0.91\ \to\ 0.1814$. (b) $Z_{Jim} = \frac{76 - 70}{3.3} = 1.82\ \to\ 0.9656$. \\\includegraphics[height=12mm]{03/figures/mikeAndJimPercentiles/mikeAndJimPercentiles}}
\end{exercise}

The last several problems have focused on finding the probability or percentile for a particular observation. What if you would like to know the observation corresponding to a particular percentile?

\begin{example}{Erik's height is at the $40^{th}$ percentile. How tall is he?}\label{normalExam40Perc}
As always, first draw the picture.\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=22mm]{03/figures/height40Perc/height40Perc}\vspace{-1mm}
\end{center}
In this case, the lower tail probability is known (0.40), which can be shaded on the diagram. We want to find the observation that corresponds to this value. As a first step in this direction, we determine the Z score associated with the $40^{th}$ percentile.

Because the percentile is below 50\%, we know $Z$ will be negative. Looking in the negative part of the normal probability table, we search for the probability \emph{inside} the table closest to 0.4000. We find that 0.4000 falls in row $-0.2$ and between columns $0.05$ and $0.06$. Since it falls closer to $0.05$, we take this one: $Z=-0.25$.

Knowing $Z_{Erik}=-0.25$ and the population parameters $\mu=70$ and $\sigma=3.3$ inches, the Z score formula can be set up to determine Erik's unknown height, labeled $x_{Erik}$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
-0.25 = Z_{Erik} = \frac{x_{Erik} - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{x_{Erik} - 70}{3.3}
\end{eqnarray*}
Solving for $x_{Erik}$ yields the height 69.18 inches. That is, Erik is about 5'9'' (this is notation for 5-feet, 9-inches).
\end{example}

\begin{example}{What is the adult male height at the $82^{nd}$ percentile?}
Again, we draw the figure first.\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=22mm]{03/figures/height82Perc/height82Perc}\vspace{-1mm}
\end{center}
Next, we want to find the Z score at the $82^{nd}$ percentile, which will be a positive value. Looking in the Z table, we find $Z$ falls in row $0.9$ and the nearest column is $0.02$, i.e. $Z=0.92$. Finally, the height $x$ is found using the Z score formula with the known mean $\mu$, standard deviation $\sigma$, and Z score $Z=0.92$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
0.92 = Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{x - 70}{3.3}
\end{eqnarray*}
This yields 73.04 inches or about 6'1'' as the height at the $82^{nd}$ percentile.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
(a) What is the $95^{th}$ percentile for SAT scores? (b) What is the $97.5^{th}$ percentile of the male heights? As always with normal probability problems, first draw a picture.\footnote{Remember: draw a picture first, then find the Z score. (We leave the pictures to you.) The Z score can be found by using the percentiles and the normal probability table. (a) We look for 0.95 in the probability portion (middle part) of the normal probability table, which leads us to row 1.6 and (about) column 0.05, i.e. $Z_{95}=1.65$. Knowing $Z_{95}=1.65$, $\mu = 1500$, and $\sigma = 300$, we setup the Z score formula: $1.65 = \frac{x_{95} - 1500}{300}$. We solve for $x_{95}$: $x_{95} = 1995$. (b) Similarly, we find $Z_{97.5} = 1.96$, again setup the Z score formula for the heights, and calculate $x_{97.5} = 76.5$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{more74Less69}
(a)~What is the probability that a randomly selected male adult is at least 6'2'' (74 inches)? (b)~What is the probability that a male adult is shorter than 5'9'' (69 inches)?\footnote{Numerical answers: (a) 0.1131. (b) 0.3821.}

\begin{example}{What is the probability that a random adult male is between 5'9'' and 6'2''?}
These heights correspond to 69 inches and 74 inches. First, draw the figure. The area of interest is no longer an upper or lower tail.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.85in]{03/figures/between59And62/between59And62}
\end{center}
The total area under the curve is~1. If we find the area of the two tails that are not shaded (from Exercise~\ref{more74Less69}, these areas are $0.3821$ and $0.1131$), then we can find the middle area:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=0.65in]{03/figures/subtracting2Areas/subtracting2Areas}

That is, the probability of being between 5'9'' and 6'2'' is 0.5048.

First find the percent who get below 1500 and the percent that get above 2000: $Z_{1500} = 0.00 \to 0.5000$ (area below), $Z_{2000} = 1.67 \to 0.0475$ (area above). Final answer: $1.0000-0.5000 - 0.0475 = 0.4525$.}

\subsection{68-95-99.7 rule}

Here, we present a useful rule of thumb for the probability of falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution. This will be useful in a wide range of practical settings, especially when trying to make a quick estimate without a calculator or Z table.

\begin{figure}[hht]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=1.9in]{03/figures/6895997/6895997}
\caption{Probabilities for falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution.}
\label{6895997}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
Use the Z table to confirm that about 68\%, 95\%, and 99.7\% of observations fall within 1, 2, and 3, standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution, respectively. For instance, first find the area that falls between $Z=-1$ and $Z=1$, which should have an area of about 0.68. Similarly there should be an area of about 0.95 between $Z=-2$ and $Z=2$.\footnote{First draw the pictures. To find the area between $Z=-1$ and $Z=1$, use the normal probability table to determine the areas below $Z=-1$ and above $Z=1$. Next verify the area between $Z=-1$ and $Z=1$ is about 0.68. Repeat this for $Z=-2$ to $Z=2$ and also for $Z=-3$ to $Z=3$.}
\end{exercise}

It is possible for a normal random variable to fall 4,~5, or~even more standard deviations from the mean. However, these occurrences are very rare if the data are nearly normal. The probability of being further than 4 standard deviations from the mean is about 1-in-30,000. For 5 and 6 standard deviations, it is about 1-in-3.5 million and 1-in-1 billion, respectively.

\begin{exercise}
SAT scores closely follow the normal model with mean $\mu = 1500$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 300$. (a) About what percent of test takers score 900 to 2100? (b) What percent score between 1500 and 2100?\footnote{(a) 900 and 2100 represent two standard deviations above and below the mean, which means about 95\% of test takers will score between 900 and 2100. (b)~Since the normal model is symmetric, then half of the test takers from part~(a) ($\frac{95\%}{2} = 47.5\%$ of all test takers) will score 900 to 1500 while 47.5\% score between 1500 and 2100.}
\end{exercise}

\section{Evaluating the normal approximation}
\label{assessingNormal}

Many processes can be well approximated by the normal distribution. We have already seen two good examples: SAT scores and the heights of US adult males. While using a normal model can be extremely convenient and helpful, it is important to remember normality is always an approximation. Testing the appropriateness of the normal assumption is a key step in many data analyses.

\subsection{Normal probability plot}

\index{normal probability plot|(}

Example~\ref{normalExam40Perc} suggests the distribution of heights of US males is well approximated by the normal model. We are interested in proceeding under the assumption that the data are normally distributed, but first we must check to see if this is reasonable.

There are two visual methods for checking the assumption of normality, which can be implemented and interpreted quickly. The first is a simple histogram with the best fitting normal curve overlaid on the plot, as shown in the left panel of Figure~\ref{fcidMHeights}. The sample mean $\bar{x}$ and standard deviation $s$ are used as the parameters of the best fitting normal curve. The closer this curve fits the histogram, the more reasonable the normal model assumption. Another more common method is examining a \term{normal probability plot}.\footnote{Also commonly called a \term{quantile-quantile plot}.}, shown in the right panel of Figure~\ref{fcidMHeights}. The closer the points are to a perfect straight line, the more confident we can be that the data follow the normal model.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{03/figures/fcidMHeights/fcidMHeights}
\caption{A sample of 100 male heights. The observations are rounded to the nearest whole inch, explaining why the points appear to jump in increments in the normal probability plot.}
\label{fcidMHeights}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}{Three data sets of 40, 100, and 400 samples were simulated from a normal distribution, and the histograms and normal probability plots of the data sets are shown in Figure~\ref{normalExamples}. These will provide a benchmark for what to look for in plots of real data.} \label{normalExamplesExample}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{03/figures/normalExamples/normalExamples}
\caption{Histograms and normal probability plots for three simulated normal data sets; $n=40$ (left), $n=100$ (middle), $n=400$ (right).}
\label{normalExamples}
\end{figure}

The left panels show the histogram (top) and normal probability plot (bottom) for the simulated data set with 40 observations. The data set is too small to really see clear structure in the histogram. The normal probability plot also reflects this, where there are some deviations from the line. However, these deviations are not strong.

The middle panels show diagnostic plots for the data set with 100 simulated observations. The histogram shows more normality and the normal probability plot shows a better fit. While there is one observation that deviates noticeably from the line, it is not particularly extreme.

The data set with 400 observations has a histogram that greatly resembles the normal distribution, while the normal probability plot is nearly a perfect straight line. Again in the normal probability plot there is one observation (the largest) that deviates slightly from the line. If that observation had deviated 3 times further from the line, it would be of much greater concern in a real data set. Apparent outliers can occur in normally distributed data but they are rare.

Notice the histograms look more normal as the sample size increases, and the normal probability plot becomes straighter and more stable.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{Are NBA player heights normally distributed? Consider all 435 NBA players from the 2008-9 season presented in Figure~\ref{nbaNormal}.\footnote{These data were collected from \urlwofont{http://www.nba.com}.}}
We first create a histogram and normal probability plot of the NBA player heights. The histogram in the left panel is slightly left skewed, which contrasts with the symmetric normal distribution. The points in the normal probability plot do not appear to closely follow a straight line but show what appears to be a ``wave''. We can compare these characteristics to the sample of 400 normally distributed observations in Example~\ref{normalExamplesExample} and see that they represent much stronger deviations from the normal model. NBA player heights do not appear to come from a normal distribution.

The data are very strongly right skewed\index{skew!example: very strong} in the histogram, which corresponds to the very strong deviations on the upper right component of the normal probability plot. If we compare these results to the sample of 40 normal observations in Example~\ref{normalExamplesExample}, it is apparent that these data show very strong deviations from the normal model.

Determine which data sets represented in Figure~\ref{normalQuantileExer} plausibly come from a nearly normal distribution. Are you confident in all of your conclusions? There are 100 (top left), 50 (top right), 500 (bottom left), and 15 points (bottom right) in the four plots.\footnote{Answers may vary a little. The top-left plot shows some deviations in the smallest values in the data set; specifically, the left tail of the data set has some outliers we should be wary of. The top-right and bottom-left plots do not show any obvious or extreme deviations from the lines for their respective sample sizes, so a normal model would be reasonable for these data sets. The bottom-right plot has a consistent curvature that suggests it is not from the normal distribution. If we examine just the vertical coordinates of these observations, we see that there is a lot of data between -20 and 0, and then about five observations scattered between 0 and 70. This describes a distribution that has a strong right skew.}

\section{Binomial distribution}
\label{binomialModel}

\index{distribution!binomial|(}

\begin{example}{Suppose we randomly selected four individuals to participate in the ``shock" study. What is the chance exactly one of them will be a success?  Let's call the four people Allen ($A$), Brittany ($B$), Caroline ($C$), and Damian ($D$) for convenience. Also, suppose 35\% of people are successes as in the previous version of this example.}\label{oneRefuser}
Let's consider a scenario where one person refuses:
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&P(A=\text{\resp{refuse}},\text{ }B=\text{\resp{shock}},\text{ }C=\text{\resp{shock}},\text{ }D=\text{\resp{shock}}) \\
 &&\quad =  P(A=\text{\resp{refuse}})\ P(B=\text{\resp{shock}})\ P(C=\text{\resp{shock}})\ P(D=\text{\resp{shock}}) \\
 &&\quad =  (0.35)  (0.65)  (0.65)  (0.65) = (0.35)^1 (0.65)^3 = 0.096
\end{eqnarray*}
But there are three other scenarios: Brittany, Caroline, or Damian could have been the one to refuse. In each of these cases, the probability is again $(0.35)^1(0.65)^3$. These four scenarios exhaust all the possible ways that exactly one of these four people could refuse to administer the most severe shock, so the total probability is $4\times(0.35)^1(0.65)^3 = 0.38$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Verify that the scenario where Brittany is the only one to refuse to give the most severe shock has probability $(0.35)^1(0.65)^3$.\footnote{$P(A=\text{\resp{shock}},\text{ }B=\text{\resp{refuse}},\text{ }C=\text{\resp{shock}},\text{ }D=\text{\resp{shock}}) = (0.65)(0.35)(0.65)(0.65) = (0.35)^1(0.65)^3$.}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{The binomial distribution}

The scenario outlined in Example~\ref{oneRefuser} is a special case of what is called the binomial distribution. The \termsub{binomial distribution}{distribution!binomial} describes the probability of having exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials with probability of a success $p$  (in Example~\ref{oneRefuser}, $n=4$, $k=1$, $p=0.35$). We would like to determine the probabilities associated with the binomial distribution more generally, i.e. we want a formula where we can use $n$, $k$, and $p$ to obtain the probability. To do this, we reexamine each part of the example.

There were four individuals who could have been the one to refuse, and each of these four scenarios had the same probability. Thus, we could identify the final probability as
\begin{eqnarray}
[\text{\# of scenarios}] \times P(\text{single scenario})
\label{genBinomialFormula}
\end{eqnarray}
The first component of this equation is the number of ways to arrange the $k=1$ successes among the $n=4$ trials. The second component is the probability of any of the four (equally probable) scenarios.

Consider $P($single scenario$)$ under the general case of $k$ successes and $n-k$ failures in the $n$ trials. In any such scenario, we apply the Multiplication Rule for independent events:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
\end{eqnarray*}
This is our general formula for $P($single scenario$)$.

\textB{\pagebreak}

Secondly, we introduce a general formula for the number of ways to choose $k$ successes in $n$ trials, i.e. arrange $k$ successes and $n-k$ failures:
\begin{eqnarray*}
{n\choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\end{eqnarray*}
The quantity ${n\choose k}$ is read \term{n choose k}.\footnote{Other notation for $n$ choose $k$ includes $_nC_k$, $C_n^k$, and $C(n,k)$.} The exclamation point notation (e.g. $k!$) denotes a \term{factorial}\label{factorialDefinitionInTheBinomialSection} expression.
\begin{eqnarray*}
&& 0! = 1 \label{zeroFactorial} \\
&& 1! = 1 \\
&& 2! = 2\times1 = 2 \\
&& 3! = 3\times2\times1 = 6 \\
&& 4! = 4\times3\times2\times1 = 24 \\
&& \vdots \\
&& n! = n\times(n-1)\times...\times3\times2\times1
\end{eqnarray*}
Using the formula, we can compute the number of ways to choose $k=1$ successes in $n=4$ trials:
\begin{eqnarray*}
{4 \choose 1} = \frac{4!}{1!(4-1)!} =  \frac{4!}{1!3!} 
	= \frac{4\times3\times2\times1}{(1)(3\times2\times1)} = 4
\end{eqnarray*}
This result is exactly what we found by carefully thinking of each possible scenario in Example~\ref{oneRefuser}.

Substituting $n$ choose $k$ for the number of scenarios and $p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$ for the single scenario probability in Equation~(\ref{genBinomialFormula}) yields the general binomial formula.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Binomial distribution} Suppose the probability of a single trial being a success is $p$. Then the probability of observing exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent trials is given by\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{eqnarray}
{n\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
\label{binomialFormula}
\end{eqnarray}
Additionally, the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the number of observed successes are\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{align}
\mu &= np
	&\sigma^2 &= np(1-p)
	&\sigma &= \sqrt{np(1-p)}
\label{binomialStats}
\end{align}}
\end{termBox}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Is it binomial? Four conditions to check.\label{isItBinomialTipBox}}
(1) The trials independent. \\
(2) The number of trials, $n$, is fixed. \\
(3) Each trial outcome can be classified as a \emph{success} or \emph{failure}. \\
(4) The probability of a success, $p$, is the same for each trial.}
\end{tipBox}

\textB{\pagebreak}

\begin{example}{What is the probability that 3 of 8 randomly selected students will refuse to administer the worst shock, i.e. 5 of 8 will?}
We would like to apply the binomial model, so we check our conditions. The number of trials is fixed ($n=8$) (condition 2) and each trial outcome can be classified as a success or failure (condition 3). Because the sample is random, the trials are independent (condition~1) and the probability of a success is the same for each trial (condition~4).

In the outcome of interest, there are $k=3$ successes in $n=8$ trials, and the probability of a success is $p=0.35$. So the probability that 3 of 8 will refuse is given by
\begin{eqnarray*}
{ 8 \choose 3}(0.35)^3(1-0.35)^{8-3}
	&=& \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!}(0.35)^3(1-0.35)^{8-3} \\
	&=& \frac{8!}{3!5!}(0.35)^3(0.65)^5
\end{eqnarray*}
Dealing with the factorial part:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \frac{8\times7\times6\times5\times4\times3\times2\times1}{(3\times2\times1)(5\times4\times3\times2\times1)} = \frac{8\times7\times6}{3\times2\times1} = 56
\end{eqnarray*}
Using $(0.35)^3(0.65)^5 \approx 0.005$, the final probability is about $56*0.005 = 0.28$.
\end{example}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{computing binomial probabilities}
The first step in using the binomial model is to check that the model is appropriate. The second step is to identify $n$, $p$, and $k$. The final step is to apply the formulas and interpret the results.}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{computing $n$ choose $k$}
In general, it is useful to do some cancelation in the factorials immediately. Alternatively, many computer programs and calculators have built in functions to compute $n$ choose $k$, factorials, and even entire binomial probabilities.}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{exercise}
If you ran a study and randomly sampled 40 students, how many would you expect to refuse to administer the worst shock? What is the standard deviation of the number of people who would refuse? Equation~(\ref{binomialStats}) may be useful.\footnote{We are asked to determine the expected number (the mean) and the standard deviation, both of which can be directly computed from the formulas in Equation~(\ref{binomialStats}): $\mu=np = 40\times 0.35 = 14$ and $\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)} = \sqrt{40\times 0.35\times 0.65} = 3.02$. Because very roughly 95\% of observations fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean (see Section~\ref{variability}), we would probably observe at least 8 but less than 20 individuals in our sample who would refuse to administer the shock.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
The probability that a random smoker will develop a severe lung condition in his or her lifetime is about $0.3$.

For example, acquaintances may have similar smoking habits.}

\label{noMoreThanOneFriendWSevereLungCondition}%
Suppose these four friends do not know each other and we can treat them as if they were a random sample from the population. Is the binomial model appropriate? What is the probability that (a) none of them will develop a severe lung condition? (b) One will develop a severe lung condition? (c) That no more than one will develop a severe lung condition?\footnote{To check if the binomial model is appropriate, we must verify the conditions. (i) Since we are supposing we can treat the friends as a random sample, they are independent. (ii) We have a fixed number of trials ($n=4$). (iii) Each outcome is a success or failure. (iv) The probability of a success is the same for each trials since the individuals are like a random sample ($p=0.3$ if we say a ``success'' is someone getting a lung condition, a morbid choice). Compute parts (a) and (b) from the binomial formula in Equation~\eqref{binomialFormula}: $P(0) =  {4 \choose 0} (0.3)^0 (0.7)^4 = 1\times1\times0.7^4 = 0.2401$, $P(1) = {4 \choose 1} (0.3)^1(0.7)^{3} = 0.4116$. Note: $0!=1$, as shown on page~\pageref{zeroFactorial}. Part (c) can be computed as the sum of parts (a) and (b): $P(0) + P(1) = 0.2401 + 0.4116 = 0.6517$. That is, there is about a 65\% chance that no more than one of your four smoking friends will develop a severe lung condition.}

\subsection{Normal approximation to the binomial distribution}

\index{distribution!binomial!normal approximation|(}

The binomial formula is cumbersome when the sample size ($n$) is large, particularly when we consider a range of observations. In some cases we may use the normal distribution as an easier and faster way to estimate binomial probabilities.

\begin{example}{Approximately 20\% of the US population smokes cigarettes. A local government believed their community had a lower smoker rate and commissioned a survey of 400 randomly selected individuals. The survey found that only 59 of the 400 participants smoke cigarettes. If the true proportion of smokers in the community was really 20\%, what is the probability of observing 59 or fewer smokers in a sample of 400 people?}\label{exactBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample}
We leave the usual verification that the four conditions for the binomial model are valid as an exercise.

The question posed is equivalent to asking, what is the probability of observing $k=0$, 1, ..., 58, or 59 smokers in a sample of $n=400$ when $p=0.20$? We can compute these 60 different probabilities and add them together to find the answer:
\begin{align*}
&P(k=0\text{ or }k=1\text{ or }\cdots\text{ or } k=59) \\
	&\qquad= P(k=0) + P(k=1) + \cdots + P(k=59) \\
	&\qquad=0.0041
\end{align*}
If the true proportion of smokers in the community is $p=0.20$, then the probability of observing 59 or fewer smokers in a sample of $n=400$ is less than 0.0041.
\end{example}

The computations in Example~\ref{exactBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample} are tedious and long. In general, we should avoid such work if an alternative method exists that is faster, easier, and still accurate. Recall that calculating probabilities of a range of values is much easier in the normal model. We might wonder, is it reasonable to use the normal model in place of the binomial distribution? Surprisingly, yes, if certain conditions are met.

\begin{exercise}
Here we consider the binomial model when the probability of a success is $p=0.10$. Figure~\ref{fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal} shows four hollow histograms for simulated samples from the binomial distribution using four different sample sizes: $n=10, 30, 100, 300$. What happens to the shape of the distributions as the sample size increases? What distribution does the last hollow histogram resemble?\footnote{The distribution is transformed from a blocky and skewed distribution into one that rather resembles the normal distribution in last hollow histogram}
\end{exercise}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{03/figures/fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal/fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal}
\caption{Hollow histograms of samples from the binomial model when $p=0.10$. The sample sizes for the four plots are $n=10$, 30, 100, and 300, respectively.}
\label{fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal}
\end{figure}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Normal approximation of the binomial distribution}
The binomial distribution with probability of success $p$ is nearly normal when the sample size $n$ is sufficiently large that $np$ and $n(1-p)$ are both at least 10. The approximate normal distribution has parameters corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of the binomial distribution:\vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{align*}
\mu &= np
&&\sigma= \sqrt{np(1-p)}
\end{align*}}
\end{termBox}

The normal approximation may be used when computing the range of many possible successes. For instance, we may apply the normal distribution to the setting of Example~\ref{exactBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample}.

\begin{example}{How can we use the normal approximation to estimate the probability of observing 59 or fewer smokers in a sample of 400, if the true proportion of smokers is $p=0.20$?} \label{approxBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample}
Showing that the binomial model is reasonable was a suggested exercise in Example~\ref{exactBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample}. We also verify that both $np$ and $n(1-p)$ are at least 10:
\begin{align*}
np&=400\times 0.20=80
&n(1-p)&=400\times 0.8=320
\end{align*}
With these conditions checked, we may use the normal approximation in place of the binomial distribution using the mean and standard deviation from the binomial model:
\begin{align*}
\mu &= np = 80
&\sigma &= \sqrt{np(1-p)} = 8
\end{align*}
We want to find the probability of observing fewer than 59 smokers using this model.

\begin{exercise}
Use the normal model $N(\mu=80, \sigma=8)$ to estimate the probability of observing fewer than 59 smokers. Your answer should be approximately equal to the solution of Example~\ref{exactBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample}: 0.0041.\footnote{Compute the Z score first: $Z=\frac{59 - 80}{8} = -2.63$. The corresponding left tail area is 0.0043.}

\subsection{The normal approximation breaks down on small intervals}

\begin{caution}
{The normal approximation may fail on small intervals}
{The normal approximation to the binomial distribution tends to perform poorly when estimating the probability of a small range of counts, even when the conditions are met.}
\end{caution}

Suppose we wanted to compute the probability of observing 69, 70, or 71 smokers in 400 when $p=0.20$. With such a large sample, we might be tempted to apply the normal approximation and use the range 69 to 71. However, we would find that the binomial solution and the normal approximation notably differ:
\begin{align*}
\text{Binomial:}&\ 0.0703
&\text{Normal:}&\ 0.0476
\end{align*}
We can identify the cause of this discrepancy using Figure~\ref{normApproxToBinomFail}, which shows the areas representing the binomial probability (outlined) and normal approximation (shaded). Notice that the width of the area under the normal distribution is 0.5 units too slim on both sides of the interval.

\end{figure}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Improving the accuracy of the normal approximation to the binomial distribution}
The normal approximation to the binomial distribution for intervals of values is usually improved if cutoff values are modified slightly. The cutoff values for the lower end of a shaded region should be reduced by 0.5, and the cutoff value for the upper end should be increased by 0.5.}
\end{tipBox}

The tip to add extra area when applying the normal approximation is most often useful when examining a range of observations. While it is possible to apply it when computing a tail area, the benefit of the modification usually disappears since the total interval is typically quite wide.
