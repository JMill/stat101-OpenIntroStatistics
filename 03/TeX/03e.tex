\eoce{\qt{Scores on the GRE, Part I\label{GRE}} A college senior who took the Graduate Record Examination exam scored 620 on the Verbal Reasoning section and 670 on the Quantitative Reasoning section. The mean score for Verbal Reasoning section was 462 with a standard deviation of 119, and the mean score for the Quantitative Reasoning was 584 with a standard deviation of 151. Suppose that both distributions are nearly normal.
\begin{parts}
\item Write down the short-hand for these two normal distributions.
\item What is her Z score on the Verbal Reasoning section? On the Quantitative Reasoning section? Draw a standard normal distribution curve and mark these two Z scores.
\item What do these Z scores tell you?
\item Relative to others, which section did she do better on?
\item Find her percentile scores for the two exams.
\item What percent of the test takers did better than her on the Verbal Reasoning section? On the Quantitative Reasoning section?
\item Explain why simply comparing her raw scores from the two sections would lead to the incorrect conclusion that she did better on the Quantitative Reasoning section.

\eoce{\qt{Triathlon times, Part I} \label{triathlon} In triathlons, it is common for racers to be placed into age and gender groups. Friends Leo and Mary both completed the Hermosa Beach Triathlon, where Leo competed in the \textit{Men, Ages 30 - 34} group while Mary competed in the \textit{Women, Ages 25 - 29} group. Leo completed the race in 1:22:28 (4948 seconds), while Mary completed the race in 1:31:53 (5513 seconds). Obviously Leo finished faster, but they are curious about how they did within their respective groups. Can you help them?
Here is some information on the performance of their groups:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item The finishing times of the \textit{Men, Ages 30 - 34} group has a mean of 4313 seconds with a standard deviation of 583 seconds.
\item The finishing times of the \textit{Women, Ages 25 - 29} group has a mean of 5261 seconds with a standard deviation of 807 seconds.
\item The distributions of finishing times for both groups are approximately Normal.
\end{itemize}
Remember: a better performance corresponds to a faster finish.
\begin{parts}
\item Write down the short-hand for these two normal distributions.
\item What are the Z scores for Leo's and Mary's finishing times? What do these Z scores tell you?
\item Did Leo or Mary rank better in their respective groups? Explain your reasoning.
\item What percent of the triathletes did Leo finish faster than in his group?
\item What percent of the triathletes did Mary finish faster than in her group?
\item If the distributions of finishing times are not nearly normal, would your answers to parts (b) - (e) change? Explain your reasoning.

\eoce{\qt{Portfolio returns} The Capital Asset Pricing Model is a financial model that assumes returns on a portfolio are normally distributed. Suppose a portfolio has an average annual return of 14.7\% (i.e. an average gain of 14.7\%) with a standard deviation of 33\%. A return of 0\% means the value of the portfolio doesn't change, a negative return means that the portfolio loses money, and a positive return means that the portfolio gains money.
\begin{parts}
\item What percent of years does this portfolio lose money, i.e. have a return less than 0\%?
\item What is the cutoff for the highest 15\% of annual returns with this portfolio?

\eoce{\qt{Temperatures in LA, Part II} Exercise~\ref{tempLA} states that average daily high temperature in June in LA is 77\degree F with a standard deviation of 5\degree F, and it can be assumed that they to follow a normal distribution. We use the following equation to convert \degree F (Fahrenheit) to \degree C (Celsius):
\[ C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}. \]
\begin{parts}
\item Write the probability model for the distribution of temperature in \degree C in June in LA.
